    1. procedural language (by c)
    2. object-oriented language (by c++)

- C++ programs can use existing C software libraries
- C follows top-down approach of programming
- C++ follows bottom-up approach of programming
- C adopts Procedure Oriented Programming
- C++ adopts Object Oriented Programming
- C++ follow both POP & OOP

    - OOP : object oriented programming (bottom to top)
