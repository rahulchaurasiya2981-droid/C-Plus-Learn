- Every software is working on information
- Any information is constant
- Data = Information = Constant

Types of constant
-----------------
A. Primary Constant (fundamental constant)
    1. Integer
    2. Real (floating)
    3. Character (any single symbol but in single quote)
    
B. Secondary Constant (derived from primary constant)
    1. Array
    2. String
    3. Pointer
    4. Union
    5. Structure
    6. Class
    7. Enumerator 

Variable
---------
- Every program consume memory in ram for = (program data) + (program instructions)
- program data is store by variable name
- Variable name of the memory location where we store data.
- Rule for variable name
    - a-z,A-Z,0-9 and "_" (only one symbol)
    - Never start with digit

Keywords
--------
- Predefined/reserved/builit-in word known by compiler
- Variable name are unkown by compiler so we need to declare properly


# C++ Data Types - Simple Notes

## 1. Primary (Fundamental) Data Types
- char,int,float,double,bool,void

## 2. Derived Data Types
- **Reference:** Alias for a variable, e.g., `int &ref = a;`  
- **Array:** Collection of elements, e.g., `int arr[5];` 
- **Pointer:** Stores memory address, e.g., `int* ptr;`  
- **Function:** Collection of elements, e.g., `int arr[5];` 
 


## 3. User-Defined Data Types
- **Class / Struct / Enum / Union / Typedef**  




## Notes
- `char` always 1 byte.  
- `int` usually 4 bytes.  
- `long` can vary based on system/compiler.  
- Pointers depend on architecture (32-bit = 4B, 64-bit = 8B)(RAM memory).  
- Use `sizeof()` to check actual size on your system.
